# Board Game Setup

Board Game Setup is a planning tool for organizing game nights. The site helps players
collect game details, assign roles, and track setup steps so a session can start fast.

## MVP goals
- Create a shared list of games with player counts, duration, and setup time.
- Capture setup checklists for each game (components, layout, and pre-game tasks).
- Share a session plan so the host can coordinate who brings what.
- Provide a fast way to mark tasks as done during setup.

## Tech stack
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend build tool.
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for an approachable starting point.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
