# Product Guidelines

## Voice and tone
- Friendly, helpful, and concise.
- Prefer clear instructions over playful copy.
- Avoid jargon unless it is a known board game term.

## UI copy rules
- Buttons: verb-first and short ("Choose another game", "Save profile").
- Empty states: explain what is missing and what to do next.
- Errors: plain language + next action when possible.
- Labels: use consistent nouns (Game, Expansion, Module, Setup step).

## Terminology
- Game: the base board game.
- Expansion: add-on content for a game.
- Module: optional rules or setup variants (base or expansion).
- Setup step: an ordered instruction in the checklist.
- Checklist: the rendered list of setup steps.

## Messaging patterns
- Status: "Loading...", "Saving...", "Signed in." (short and factual).
- Errors: "Missing Supabase configuration.", "No setup steps found."
- Empty state: "No expansions listed yet.", "Request form coming soon."

## Accessibility
- Use clear aria labels for icon-only controls.
- Avoid placeholder-only labels for forms.
